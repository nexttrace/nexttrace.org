          Social distancing, if widely adopted, works. Unfortunately, it's
          unsustainable. If we continue distancing, it may devastate our society. 
          But if we stop before a vaccine is ready, it will cause a
          rebound in infections because not enough of us are immune.

          Contact tracing â€” at scale
        </Heading>
        <Text sx={{ mb: [3] }}>
         When an individual is diagnosed with COVID-19, we can ask who they came
         in contact with, or may have given it to, and encourage them to isolate
         and get tested. That process, called {' '}
         <Link href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing'><b>contact tracing</b></Link>, 
         forms of the basis of classic
         epidemiological methods for controlling infectious disease. We know it
         works, we just need to do it with everyone. 
        </Text>
        <Text sx={{mb: [3]}}>
          Our first deliverable is a complete system for <b>contact tracing at
          scale</b> that can be deployed in the short term by public health 
          officials around the country. We are a team of scientists, epidemiologists, 
          and software developers. We are leveraging web-based survey instrumentation,
          messaging, and other tech components. We are using modern technology, but
          deeply grounded in science.

          Our approach does not require advanced location-based tracking to
          work, though can incorporate it as it becomes available. We are working 
          collaboratively with other efforts and sharing best practices as we go.
